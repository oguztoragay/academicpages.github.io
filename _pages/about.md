I am **Oguz Toragay**, a Ph.D. Candidate in [Industrial and Systems Engineering Department](https://eng.auburn.edu/insy/) at [Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu/). I hold a M.Sc. degree in [Industrial Engineering](https://mf-em.gazi.edu.tr/?language=en_US) from [Gazi University](https://gazi.edu.tr/?language=en_US) in Turkey and a B.Sc. degree in Applied Mathematics from Khayyam University in Iran.

Some of my academic activities during my Ph.D. journey, are included in this webpage.



Research
======
During my Ph.D., I involved in a multidisciplinary project in collaboration with Mechanical Engineering and National Center for Additive Manufacturing Excellence (NCAME) at Auburn University. 

I, specifically work on applications of various optimization methods to optimize the design of lightweight structures for Additive Manufacturing (AM). We proposed a new mathematical model for the complex problem of designing lightweight planar frame structures using Mixed Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming approach. 

Our paper, presenting the proposed idea, is under review with one of the major journals in the field, “Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization Journal”.

I am currently working on applications of heuristic and metaheuristic methods to solve large-scale design problems for AM. My research is impactful in terms of bringing the optimization methods and AM closer. 

Lightweight structures has applications in aerospace, automotive and medical fields for which having an optimized design is highly important. In our research, we tackle this engineering problem and I believe our contributions will have significant impact in the field.

Teaching
======
I had the chance for teaching an undergrad course for which I was the instructor of record and I was able to successfully implement my teaching philosophy. The student evaluations showed that it was a successful semester for me as the instructor. For details of my teaching experience, visit the "Teaching" tab.
