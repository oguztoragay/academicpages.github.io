This article presents a study on the job shop problem, a combinatorial optimization problem that models scheduling and resource allocation in industrial settings. The article aims to investigate the relationship between optimality gap and required computational resources, considering various optimality gap levels that are applicable in real-life situations. The study uses a Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the behavior of solvers in solving different sizes of random-generated scheduling problems. The findings of the study offer insights into the worthiness of reaching an optimal solution versus implementing a near-optimal solution and starting the work. The codes used in the study are accessible on the author's GitHub account.
