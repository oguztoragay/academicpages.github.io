Manufacturing Systems I
---
Fall 2020, I had the chance to teach an undergrade course (_Manufacturing Systems I_) for which I had the full responsibility to desing the course, design the syllabus (given [here]()), teach the course, make the exams and manage the hybrid teaching environment. Although some of the course material were based on the ones taht I had experience with from the course that I was TA for, but, modifying everything to a hybrid class was one of the challenges that I faced. Due to COVID-19, most of the students prefered to stay at home and follow the live Zoom classroom. After each class, I edit the recorded classroom and uploaded the recording to course's website in order to make them evailable for those students who could not watch the class live. During that semester thanks to COVID-19, I overcame many challenges that were abnormal for an instructor who teach a class for the first time. Students' evaluation on the other hand showed that, those challenges were steps for the success. With their evaluations they once more reminded me that I made a right decision in choosing to pursue academic career. Below are some of the comments that I received in the anonymous evaluation form:

> *Oguz did a great job teaching this course this semester! The material was very graspable and I retained more from this class from most others I took this semester*

> *Dr. Toragay is an excellent professor. He seems to understand the material well and cares about the success if his students. I would take a class from him again. He teaches right from the slides, but the slides are content packed. He delivers the information well. The robot project could have used a little more explaining, but it was a good project and I learned a lot from it.*

> *Professor Toragay was very engaged during class. Although it is harder to teach students remotely, I felt that he did an excellent job in conveying our material.*

> *Professor Oguz did a great job on lectures and providing feedback for our group project. My only downside to this class were the labs. They were very challenging to do with the remote desktop and I do not feel like I got any beneÂ¦cial knowledge out of them by doing them online.*

> *The project and especially the labs that were assigned was very hard and inconvenient to perform giving the circumstances of this semester.*
