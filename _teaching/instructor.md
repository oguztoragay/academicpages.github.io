Manufacturing Systems I
---
Fall 2020, I had the chance to teach an undergrade course (_Manufacturing Systems I_) for which I had the full responsibility to desing the course, design the syllabus (given [here]()), teach the course, make the exams and manage the hybrid teaching environment. Although most of the material were based on the ones taht I had experience with from teh course that I was TA for, but, modifying everything to a hybrid class was one of the challenges that I faced. Due to COVID-19, most of the students prefered to stay at home and follow the live Zoom classroom. After each class, I edit the recorded classroom and uploaded the recording to course's website in order to make them evailable for those who could not watch the class live. During that semester thanks to COVID-19, I overcame many challenges that were abnormal for an instructor who teach a class for the first time. Students' evaluation on the other hand showed that those challenges were steps for the success. With their evaluations they once more reminded me that I made a right decision in choosing to pursue academic career. Below are some of the comments that I received in the anonymous evaluation form:
