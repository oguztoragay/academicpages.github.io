Manufacturing Systems I
---
Fall 2020, I had the chance to teach an undergrade course (_Manufacturing Systems I_) for which I had the full responsibility to desing the course, design the syllabus (given [here]()), teach the course, make the exams and manage the hybrid teaching environment. Although some of the course material were based on the ones taht I had experience with from the course that I was TA for, but, modifying everything to a hybrid class was one of the challenges that I faced. Due to COVID-19, most of the students prefered to stay at home and follow the live Zoom classroom. After each class, I edit the recorded classroom and uploaded the recording to course's website in order to make them evailable for those students who could not watch the class live. During that semester thanks to COVID-19, I overcame many challenges that were abnormal for an instructor who teach a class for the first time. Students' evaluation on the other hand showed that, those challenges were steps for the success. With their evaluations they once more reminded me that I made a right decision in choosing to pursue academic career. Below are some of the comments that I received in the anonymous evaluation form:

> *Oguz did a great job teaching this course this semester! The material was very graspable and I retained more from this class from most others I took this semester*

> *Dr. Toragay is an excellent professor. He seems to understand the material well and cares about the success if his students. I would take a class from him again. He teaches right from the slides, but the slides are content packed. He delivers the information well. The robot project could have used a little more explaining, but it was a good project and I learned a lot from it.*

> *Professor Toragay was very engaged during class. Although it is harder to teach students remotely, I felt that he did an excellent job in conveying our material.*

> *Professor Oguz did a great job on lectures and providing feedback for our group project. My only downside to this class were the labs. They were very challenging to do with the remote desktop and I do not feel like I got any beneÂ¦cial knowledge out of them by doing them online.*

> *The project and especially the labs that were assigned was very hard and inconvenient to perform giving the circumstances of this semester.*


# Teaching Assistant Experience
===

## Probability and Statistics I

For this course I was a Teaching Assistant. The course instructor was [Dr. Ashkan Negahban](https://greatvalley.psu.edu/person/ashkan-negahban). The course covered introductory discussions in Probability and Statistics. 

## Stochastic Optimization 

This course was intended as an introductory class in stochastic operations research discussing how probability and statistics can be used in analytics, decision making and mathematical modeling. It included Markov chains, queuing theory and inventory control topics. This course was taught by [Dr. Alexander Vinel](https://eng.auburn.edu/directory/azv0019). 

## Dynamic Programming

Introduction to sequential decision making with emphasis on formulation and solution using Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithms. The course covered deterministic and
stochastic dynamic programming problems in finite and infinite horizons, under the total, discounted and long run average cost criteria. This course was a grad level course taught by [Dr. Daniel F. Silva](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/dfs0008).

## Manufacturing Systems II 

This course provided an introduction to the design and operation of manufacturing systems. The focus was on using mathematical modeling and advanced analytical tools such as linear programming, simulation and statistics to analyze, control, improve and optimize several aspects of manufacturing systems. This course was taught by [Dr. Daniel F. Silva](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/dfs0008).

## Manufacturing Systems I

Classical industrial and systems engineering related to the design and evaluation of manufacturing systems and the understanding of manufacturing processes. The course was taught by [Dr. Richard Garnett](https://eng.auburn.edu/directory/rfg0004).
